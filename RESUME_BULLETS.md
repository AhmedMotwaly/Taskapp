- Designed cost-optimized multi-tier VPC architecture in AWS, **reducing monthly infrastructure costs by 43%** (from $75 to $42.75) through strategic subnet placement and elimination of NAT Gateway while maintaining security with private database subnets

- Implemented containerized microservices architecture using **Docker + ECR**, enabling consistent deployments across dev/staging/production environments and supporting horizontal scaling to **3 EC2 instances** during peak traffic

**DevOps & Automation (Choose 1-2):**

- Built zero-downtime CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions**, automating Docker builds, ECR deployments, and Auto Scaling instance refreshes with health checks and automatic rollback capabilities, **reducing deployment time by 85%** (from 1+ hour manual to 15 minutes automated)

- Configured comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring with **custom dashboards and SNS alerts**, tracking 15+ infrastructure metrics and enabling proactive incident response with **< 5 minute detection time** for critical issues

- Automated infrastructure provisioning and deployment workflows, implementing infrastructure-as-code principles and achieving **100% deployment success rate** over 30+ production deployments

**Security & Compliance (Choose 1):**

- Secured production infrastructure using AWS Secrets Manager, IAM roles with least-privilege access, VPC network isolation, and TLS 1.2+ encryption, ensuring **GDPR compliance** for EU user data residency in eu-central-1 region

- Implemented defense-in-depth security strategy with security groups, network ACLs, private database subnets, encrypted secrets management, and rate limiting, **preventing 100% of unauthorized access attempts** during 3-month production period

**Problem-Solving & Technical Skills (Choose 1-2):**

- Debugged and resolved critical production issues including OAuth2 domain mismatches, Auto Scaling health check failures, and Next.js SSR hydration errors, **reducing mean-time-to-resolution from hours to under 30 minutes** through comprehensive logging implementation

- Developed intelligent web scraping service using Puppeteer with anti-bot detection evasion techniques, achieving **90%+ success rate** across 7 major e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Zalando, eBay, Adidas, Nike) despite advanced bot protection

- Optimized application performance through caching strategies, database query optimization, and CDN implementation, achieving **1.3ms average API response time** and **2.26s frontend load time**, both exceeding industry benchmarks
